# Understanding the Gender Pay Gap
Gender wage disparity is a multifaceted issue rooted in societal norms and systemic biases. Despite progress made in terms of gender equality, there continues to be a disparity in wages in numerous vocations. The purpose of this analysis is to discern whether there is a significant difference in the proportions of men and women who earn more than 50K in the United States. 

The analysis involves conducting a hypothesis test using both bootstrapping and classical methods, as well as calculating a confidence interval for the true value of the difference in proportions. All code was completed in R using the platform JupyterNotebook.

This report was completed as a project for the Statistical Inference for Data Science course at the University of British Columbia.
